## My process

### Built with

- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.dev/)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.7.

### What I Learned

This was my first project using Angular which I created to exercise basic Angular concepts: components, Inputs (known as Props in React) and for structure.

Undestand most concepts was simple because I've learnt React.js and some instructions are similar, but the folder structure and file separation was newer to me.

The most difficult thing to me was to understand how to pass Inputs correctly, because em React we don't need to pass props between quotation marks like in Angular.

In react we use the props like:

```jsx
<SomeComponent propName={propValue} />
```

But in Angular the Inputs are like that:

```html
<some-component inputName="{{ inputValue }}" />
```



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
